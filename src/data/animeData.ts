		description: `Gol D. Roger was dubbed the "Pirate King" due to his outstanding power and feared dominance over the Grand Line's seas. The Global authorities' seizure and execution of Roger caused a global uproar. However, before his death, Roger disclosed the remarkable existence of One Piece, the world's most coveted treasure. This revelation triggered the onset of the Grand Age of Pirates, brave sailors willing to undertake perilous journeys in pursuit of the immeasurable wealth and prestige that One Piece offered.
			Monkey D. Luffy, an unconventional 17-year-old, answered this call to adventure. Luffy's personality does not fit the typical pirate stereotype; he is not cruel or savage, instead seeking exciting escapades, the thrill of exploration, and the chance to meet fascinating individuals while searching for One Piece. Luffy and his crew set sail, embarking on a daring odyssey teeming with fantastic adventures, perplexing mysteries, and epic battles to lay claim to One Piece's unparalleled legacy, just as Luffy's childhood hero did.`,

The church is home to the "Saint," a symbol of good morals who provides sincere advice to every parishioner. Cecilia, a kind-hearted girl, is tasked with the responsibility of tending to the Saint, but the job becomes exhausting for her. Her tendency to fall asleep at any given moment only adds to her burden, leaving Lawrence to take care of the church alone. Despite the challenges, the two forge a trusting friendship, with Lawrence accommodating Cecilia's laid-back approach, and Cecilia becoming comfortable with Lawrence's overly-protective nature. However, as the Saint's affection for the dense pastor goes beyond friendship, Lawrence must decide how he will respond.`,

		description: `Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money. One wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past. Now in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?`,
